          Inspired by Ray Bradbury, Ray was born out of a simple directive of his:
          read a short story for 1,000 nights. We took this quote and ran with it,
          creating our own vision for a daily reading experience.

            I'll give you a programme to follow every night. Very simple

            every night, read one short story.
